This project performs end-to-end data cleaning and exploratory analysis on the PaySim dataset, a synthetic simulation of mobile money transactions. Using Python and Tableau, I identify transaction patterns, detect unusual behavior, and explore characteristics of fraudulent activity. The project aims to showcase practical EDA, data storytelling, and visualization skills for financial data.
